                            <b>The SME is an initiative by Precious Radebe to provide skills training for domestic workers and gardeners. Her parents and other elderly relatives were never given the chance to upskill themselves or follow a formal educational qualification, so this training school is her way of supporting similarly affected members from her community. The training she provides upskills domestic workers and gardeners by making them more marketable when seeking employment and enables them to be paid at a higher rate because of these additional skills. They can also be entrepreneurs and setup their own small business utilising these newly obtained skills. Many employers would like to have their employees upskilled to offer more skilled services to the household.</b>
